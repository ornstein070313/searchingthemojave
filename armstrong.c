/*Write a C program to find Armstrong Numbers within m and n where m, n are user inputs. 
A number n is called an Armstrong number if the sum of its digitsâ€™ to the power k is equal to n, 
where k is the number of digits in n. For e.g. 407 is an Armstrong number because 407 contains 
3 digits and 43+03+73 = 407. 1634 is also an Armstrong number because 1634 contains 4 digits 
and 1^4+6^4+3^4+4^4 = 1634.
Sample input/output :
Enter starting and ending range: 1 2000
Armstrong numbers between 1 and 2000 are:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 153, 370, 371, 407, 1634,
